## Simple ML
Simple python implementations of the most popular machine learning algorithms.



###### Objective
Increase my familarity with and understanding of the most popular ML tools by implementing them
in python,


I don't plan to write extensive docstrings or much if any testing nor do I aim to achieve comparable
computational performance to that of the most popular ML libraries currently available. The aim is soley to 
understand the underlying math and Comp-sci on a more fundamental level.
